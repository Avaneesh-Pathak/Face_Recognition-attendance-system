## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **dlib installation fails**:
  - Ensure you have CMake installed. On Windows, install Visual Studio with C++ build tools.
  - Try installing the pre-built wheel manually if pip fails.

- **Camera not detected**:
  - Check if another application is using the camera.
  - Verify OpenCV can access index 0 (default camera).

- **Migrations not applying**:
  - Delete `db.sqlite3` and run migrations again if you face conflicts.
  - Ensure `makemigrations` is run before `migrate`.



## 💡 Usage

- 👨‍💼 **Admin** can add employees, view attendance reports, and monitor real-time stats.  
- 🧑‍💻 **Employees** can mark attendance automatically by standing in front of the camera.  
- 🕒 The system records **check-in** and **check-out** times along with a **confidence score** for each recognition event.  
- 📊 Attendance data is updated in real time and can be filtered by **date, week, or month**.
